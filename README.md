## 📊 Final Results — Sentiment Impact Summary

| Sentiment | Avg PnL | Win-Rate | Volume Traded |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Greed** | **82.84** 🔥 | 40.78% | 77M |
| **Neutral** | 57.93 | **40.89% (highest)** | **475M (accumulation)** |
| **Extreme Greed** | 25.41 | 49% | 39M |

### 🧠 Interpretation

✔ Greed phase produces the **highest profitability**  
✔ Neutral attracts **institutional-scale volume**  
✔ Extreme Greed shows **end-cycle euphoria**, instability risk  
✔ Win-rate strongest in **Neutral & Extreme Greed**

## 📈 Buy vs Sell Performance

| Sentiment | Avg PnL (Buy) | Avg PnL (Sell) | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Greed** | -14.76 ⛔ | **165.35 🔥** | *Best to Sell in Greed* |
| **Neutral** | **72.69** | 42.91 | Buy strength during Neutral |
| **Extreme Greed** | 25.57 | 25.27 | Symmetric, lower edge |

---

## 💡 Trading Strategy Extracted From Data

> 📌 **Buy during Neutral sentiment** → stable growth, high win-rate  
> 📌 **Sell/Take Profit during Greed** → strongest sell-side profit spike  
> 📌 **Treat Extreme Greed as exit/TP zone** → prevent reversals  
> 📌 Avoid Buying in Greed (−14 PnL avg)

This framework can be automated into an **alpha-signal trading system**.
